# pythonTexTools

This package provides a simple way to export information from Python to LaTeX for automatic document production such as reports or student projects.
 
## Setup:

- Clone the repo
- Install with `pip install -e .` or `pip install -e .[dev]`


## Usage:

1. Initialize the object: `exporter = tex_exporter(dir_name=\<Name of the output directory\>)`
2. Add a variable to the tex_exporter object: `exporter.add_var(my_variable_name, my_value)`
3. Create the .tex File after you've added all information to the exporter: `exporter.export()`

The files are then written to a .tex file in your output directory. You can include this
file in you latex document by using \include{document_name.tex}. All previously added
variables and figures are represented by a \var\<variable_name\> command.
